# The Team
DotNetFriday is an initiative by Eduard Keilholz. Eduard works as a cloud solution architect at 4DotNet. Together with Jan de Vries, Jan Willem de Wagt and with a lot
of support from 4DotNet, we were able to start this meetup platform. Our aim is sharing information and knowledge about Microsoft development technologies. This includes Azure, Azure DevOps, Visual Studio, .NET, .NET Core, GitHub and so on.
