  sessions:
  - title: Take control of your Azure subscription
    start: 12:00 (CET)
    end: 12:50 (CET)
    description: A lot of people are proficient in deploying and managing their Azure subscriptions nowadays. What I see happen quite often is there's a lot of manual configuration going on and stuff you 'just need to know'. This is a problem! What you should strive for is an automated way to deploy your complete subscription using predefined policies, having security checks in place and, if necessary, scripts in your pipelines to get control of your subscription.

  sessions:
  - title: Testing and monitoring distributed applications build using Azure Functions, CosmosDB and Service Bus
    start: 13:00 (CET)
    end: 13:50 (CET)
    description: We have all seen the flashy presentations on building distributed applications using cloud offerings as Azure CosmosDB, Functions and messaging solutions. But how do you test such an application? How do you ensure that you do not only deploy fast and often, but can also be confident that your new deployments work reliable?
                 In this session I will share my experiences with testing, deploying and monitoring distributed systems built using these cloud-native technologies. You will learn about the different types of tests used, dealing with databases, messaging systems and much more. And what about after the deployment, how do you monitor the quality of your application while running in production? What do you monitor when operating such a distributed system? And how?
                 Join Henry Been to learn how you can not only build your new cloud services architecture, but can also test and operate it so you can reliable ship new features faster!

  sessions:
  - title: Embracing gRPC in .NET
    start: 14:00 (CET)
    end: 14:50 (CET)
    description: With an increasing need for scalability and performance dictated by the modern web, it becomes harder and harder to choose an API paradigm that is suitable for service to service communication.
                 While the classical models still work and have their own merits, some of them rely heavily on documentation, extensive coordination between teams or code-sharing. We use shared libraries, and over time our projects become intertwined with dependencies. In these cases, we need something to untangle those and reduce coupling. Welcome gRPC.
                 gRPC has been around for a while and .NET Core 3.0 welcomes it as a first-class citizen. It is contract-based, performant - with smaller response/request bodies, perfect for polyglot environments and supports different models â€“ from client-server, to bi-directional streaming out of the box.
                 In this session, we will look at how to use gRPC and its 4 models and what are the benefits and or downsides of using gRPC compared to the traditional models.

  - title: Azure Resource Manager templates deep dive
    start: 15:00 (CET)
    end: 15:50 (CET)
    description: There are multiple options in Azure to create your resources like VMs, databases or Web Apps. The Azure Resource Manager is one of them and ideal for infrastructure as code scenarios. In this session we will spend a few minutes on the basics of ARM and then quickly go into more depth on the advanced ARM-template topics! First, we will talk about how to organize your templates. As with normal code, we will try to create nicely structured and reusable templates. Linked templates can help tremendously with that so we will dive in those as well. We will look at quite some interesting template functions because they will make our templates more powerful and reusable.

  sessions:
  - title: Codespaces, Developing from your iPad, browser, VS Code or anywhere!
    start: 16:00 (CET)
    end: 16:50 (CET)
    description: In this session we will look at Codespaces. The new solution by Microsoft which enabled you to move your development environment into the cloud. Do you still have an old machine sitting under your desk, perfectly configured for that one VB6 legacy app? Or is onboarding new team members costing your hours or even days?
                 With Codespaces you can get fix all that and get a fully powered development machine up and running in 30 seconds. Say bye to the README.md, just give people a Codespace which has everything they need.
                 During this session I will show you what Codespaces is and how you can start writing code without installing tools and SDKs for hours on end. We will see how to use Codespaces as a separate solution, from VS Code, in a browser and even directly built into GitHub.
